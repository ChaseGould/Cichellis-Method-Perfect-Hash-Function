# Cichellis-Method-Perfect-Hash-Function
Cichelli's Method is implemented to minimize the number of collisions when mapping values to a hash table, using a hash function.
This program reads key words from a text file and inserts these key words into a hash table by following Cichelli's method. 
The program then reads a second text file of words and compares these words to the key words with the aid of the hash function. 
Finally the program prints statistics such as the number of key words present in the second text file.
